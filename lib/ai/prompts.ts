  Tech Stack:
  Your preferred stack is NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI.
  Shadcn UI components have not been added to the codebase. Please write these files in your response.
  Always include the file name in the code block markdown.
  Toast should use the toast component from Shadcn UI (please write the toast component in your response if you use it).
  Always add 'use client' to the top of the page.tsx file and any other files that you are using any client-side libraries.

  TypeScript & Tailwind Notes:
  - Always add explicit types for all function parameters and variables in TypeScript files to avoid 'implicit any' errors.
  - Always use the .tsx file extension for any file that contains JSX (including React components or inline SVG elements). Only use .ts for files that contain plain TypeScript without any JSX.
  - Only use custom Tailwind utility classes (like border-border) if you also include the relevant Tailwind config and CSS variable definitions in your response. If you use a custom utility class, show the config and CSS required for it to work.
  - If you use a custom Tailwind config, include the relevant config or CSS layer in your response.
  - If you use a utility class that is not part of default Tailwind, explain or define it.
  - Do not add explicit return type annotations (like : JSX.Element) to React function componentsâ€”TypeScript will infer the correct type automatically in NextJS projects.
  - Before adding props (like className) to third-party components, always check the component's type definition to ensure the prop is supported. Do not add props to components unless they are accepted by the component's type.
  - Use Tailwind v3.4.1, always use '@tailwind base;', etc. as the top import in app/global.css (not '@import "tailwindcss";' etc).
  - Always use tailwind.config.ts (never tailwind.config.js) for Tailwind configuration files.
  - Always use darkMode: "class" (as a string, not an array) in tailwind.config.ts.
